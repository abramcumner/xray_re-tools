[Introduction]
converter is designed to handle S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game and tools (LE/AE)
assets. It implements the following functions:
 - .ogf to .object conversion
 - .ogf to .bones skeleton extraction
 - .ogf/.omf to .skls/.skl extraction
 - .dm to .object conversion
 - game level to LE scene conversion
 - game archive packing/unpacking
 - .dds to .tga multi-conversion

converter is a console application (Start -> Run -> cmd.exe). Tested on
Windows XP SP2/SP3 only.


[Installation]
Specify $sdk_root$ in fsconverter.ltx and copy that file into converter
folder. Do the same with paths in converter.ini (this file can also be
placed in $sdk_root$). These steps are only needed for -level and
-dds2tga options, otherwise no configuration is required.

It is strongly recommended to use -ro option (operation without any
writing on disk) after any configuration changes.


[.ogf to .object conversion]
Command line:
 converter [-ogf] [-object] <input> [-out <output>]

The name of output file is generated automatically if -out <output>
option is not specified.

Notes/problems:
 - tool does not recover skeleton bind pose for OGF v3 (builds 1098,
   1114, 1154) but it is often possible to restore it manually in
   Maya/3ds Max using idle animation.
 - tool does not yet recover motion marks introduced in Clear Sky
   (including build 3120). Also, MOD SDK 0.4 ignores third and fourth
   bone that influence vertices.
 - it is not guaranteed that the "main" side of the two-sided surfaces
   will be detected correctly.


[.ogf to .bones skeleton extraction]
Command line:
 converter [-ogf] -bones <input> [-out <output>]

The name of output file is generated automatically if -out <output>
option is not specified.


[.ogf/.omf to .skls extraction]
Command line:
 converter [-ogf|-omf] -skls <input> [-out <output>]

The name of output file is generated automatically if -out <output>
option is not specified.

Notes:
 - motions are saved as step-form curves.


[.ogf/.omf to .skl extraction]
Command line:
 converter [-ogf|-omf] -skl <motion_name> <input> [-out <output>]

The name of output file is generated automatically if -out <output>
option is not specified.

Notes/problems:
 - incorrect handling of names with whitespaces.
 - see the note about step-formed curves.


[.dm to .object conversion]
Command line:
 converter [-dm] [-object] <input> [-out <output>]

The name of output file is generated automatically if -out <output>
option is not specified.

Notes:
 - the min/max scale is not saved in output .object, but it is possible
   to view this information using -info option.


[game level to LE scene conversion]
Command line:
 converter -level <level_name> [-out <scene_name>] [-mode maya|le|le2]

-mode option specifies operation mode:
 maya	- decompile level geometry only.
 le	- decompile whole level into LE scene.
 le2	- decompile whole level into LE scene (for l12_stancia_2).
 raw	- decompile whole level into LE scene (debug mode).

The handling of -with_lods option depends on the -mode value. When
-mode maya is specified, converter will output MU-models in addition
to the main level geometry. When -mode specifies another mode,
converter will output LOD-textures for MU-models.

Additional debug parameters: -dbgcfrm, -dbgmrg.

Notes/problems:
 - visual geometry in levels from builds 1098, 1114, 1154 often
   are not compatible with contemporary xrLC (i.e. contains errors).
   At least some of them are detected during conversion and saved
   in $log$\converter_<scene_name>.err
 - it is impossible to use trees from early builds (1098-1154) with
   current engine shaders. Replace them with normal MU-models.
 - visual geometry in levels from builds 2215-3312 (ShoC) does not
   contain errors such as zero-area faces however they can appear
   during xrLC optimization stage. This happens for l11_pripyat.
 - on the contrary, geometry from builds 3456 and above (CS) does
   contain errors as interpreted by xrLC from MOD SDK 0.4.
 - draft levels are decompiled with incorrect compiler shader.
 - light protectors/reflectors and caches are fixed level geometry, so
   any changes in their visual appearance require full level rebuild.
 - Wallmarks (wallmark.part) are recovered only if there is redundant
   level.wallmarks file.
 - converter does not handle case when level.snd_env contains
   intersecting sound volumes. There are no real examples in
   original game (ShoC) or addon (CS).
 - detail models are always two-sided to render correctly in LE.
 - AI map (level.ai/ai_map.part) sometimes is placed below the visual
   geometry (e.g. l08_yantar). The reason is unknown.


[Game archive packing/unpacking]
Command line to unpack:
 converter -unpack <archive> [-1114|-2215|-2945|-2947ru|-2947|-xdb]

Command line to pack:
 converter -pack <folder> [-2947ru|-2947ww|-xdb]

Notes:
 - Use -xdb to unpack Clear Sky archives.


[.dds to .tga multi-conversion]
Command line:
 converter -dds2tga [-with_solid] [-with_bump]

The tool scans all .thm files in $textures$ and converts .dds from
$game_textures$ into .tga. Existing .tga files are not overwritten.

Specify -with_solid option to handle the non-transparent textures
as well as required for xrLC -gi.

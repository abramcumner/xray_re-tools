[Programms requipments]
 - X-Ray MOD SDK
 - MOD SDK + S.T.A.L.K.E.R. version 1.0004 and higher


[Specified files and folders]
aiwrapper.exe		- main-constructor
fsaiwrapper.ltx		- paths ways for aiwrapper
aiwrapper.ini		- settings file for aiwrapper
2215\			- shadow tree, which xrAI uses 
                    from build 2215 (all updates in it 
                    aiwrapper is doing automaticly)

deprecated\links.sample	- example of changing edges of AI-graph


[Installation]
Copy aiwrapper.exe and fsaiwrapper.ltx to any folder,
fix needs path $sdk_root$ (root folder of SDK),
$2215_fs_root$ (path to shadow tree build 2215) and $cs_fs_root$
(path to CS tree). Last needs only for aiwrapper -upgrade.

Put aiwrapper.ini into folder with aiwrapper.exe, or into $sdk_root$.

Set $sdk_root$ in $2215_fs_root$\fsgame.ltx.

After that execute one time:
	> aiwrapper -split_spawns

and if you use modified game:
	> aiwrapper -split_paths

This commands will split all.spawn into original level.spawn/level.game.

Enumerated files below are in use during work of aiwrapper and xrAI:
gamedata\config\*
gamedata\game.graph
gamedata\spawns\all.spawn
gamedata\levels\*\level.ai
gamedata\levels\*\level.game
gamedata\levels\*\level.gct
gamedata\levels\*\level.graph
gamedata\levels\*\level.spawn


[Commandline settings of aiwrapper]
Old xrAI parametres:
 -h or -?	- help in english
 -verify <map_name>	- check AI-greed connections for map in
			  gamedata\levels\<map_name>\
 -f <map_name>	- build AI-greed for map in 
		  gamedata\levels\<map_name>\
 -draft		- draft build of AI-greed (without calculating covers)
 -g <map_name>	- build AI-graph and crosstable with AI-greed 
		- for map in gamedata\levels\<map_name>\
 -m		- gather AI-graphs points of maps into one global game graph
 -s		- build all.spawn

Own parametres:
 -fs <file>	- use your own file for setting pathes
		  (default is fsaiwrapper.ltx)
 -fast_sync	- update only old files in shadow tree
 -split_spawns	- break all.spawn to original level.spawn's
 -split_paths	- break all.spawn to original level.game's
 -check_paths	- check all.spawn for presence of walk-pathes with hanging vertex'es
 -upgrade <version>	- reconstruct преобразовать final game.graph,
		  spawns\all.spawn and
		  levels\*\level.{ai|gct|env_mod|ps_static} to CS format. 
              setting <version> should be 3120 for leaked GC'07 build 
              or 3502 and more for final versions of CS.

Old parametres:
 -m2 <file>	- gather AI-graphs of maps into one game graph with
              link changes from your stated file
 -dump_gp	- put list of original AI-graph vertex'es to
              file with name links.output

[Introdaction in AI-graph]
New level should have at least one graph_point and have
level_changers to other maps. There are two types of level changers.
First type is used only by player and can added to LE or with acdc.pl.(we dont discuss them)
Second type is needed for AI-objects moving. AI-transitions(level changers)
for maps for which we have src you can set in LE. If you havent have
src, you can use converter.exe.

Usually one AI-graph point is not enough. 
You can look needed density using this LUA function:

function show_game_graph()
	local gg = game_graph()
	for gvid=0,2791 do
		if gg:valid_vertex_id(gvid) then
			local vertex = gg:vertex(gvid)
			local level_name = alife():level_name(vertex:level_id())
			local lvid = vertex:level_vertex_id()
			local pos = vertex:level_point()
			local obj = alife():create("medkit", pos, lvid, gvid)
			level.map_add_object_spot_ser(obj.id, "alife_presentation_monstr", level_name..":"..gvid)
		end
	end
end


[Building AI-components of map]
1) Add level to list in gamedata\config\game_levels.ltx
2) LevelEditor -> Compile -> Make Game, там же Make AI-Map и Build.
3) Build draft AI-greed: 
	> aiwrapper -draft -f <map_name>
   Output: gamedata\levels\<map_name>\level.ai.
4) Check link connections into AI-greed:
	> aiwrapper -verify <map_name>
   In case of error you should fix AI-cells in LE and repeat from step 2.
5) Calculating covers for AI-greed. You should first build geometry
   to have build.cform (xrLC, we will not discuss it here). Command:
	> aiwrapper -f <map_name>
   This step is optional and not needs on only stages of map testing.
6) Build AI-graphs:
	> aiwrapper -g <map_name>
   Output: gamedata\levels\<map_name>\level.{graph|gct.raw}
7) Gather AI-graphs of maps into one global game graph:
	> aiwrapper -m
   Output: gamedata\game.graph and gamedata\levels\*\level.gct
   (look below in case if we dont have src of maps)
8) Build all.spawn
	> aiwrapper -s
   Output: gamedata\spawns\all.spawn
9) Add level_changer to new map using acdc.pl.
   We dont discuss this here.
10) Register your level in gamedata\config\game_maps_single.ltx.
   We dont discuss this here.


[Notes]
 - It looks like xrAI from 2215 calculating AI-graphs a bit different,
   including connection points between levels in global graph. This
   can affect to speed and also ways of characters moving between maps.
 - As the result of final building of full game all maps level.gct 
   will be updated, so this files will need to include spread with 
   your mod. 


[Setting connections between maps without src -- old information]
For building reverse connections with maps without src you should build
game.graph with command:
	> aiwrapper -m2 <file_with_additional_connections_descriptions>

List of target points(vertexes) for AI-level_changers you can get with:
	> aiwrapper -dump_graph <file_name>

Example of this file is here: deprecated\links.sample.

After gathering of AI-graphs you can look your result by this:
	> ggtool.pl game.graph
